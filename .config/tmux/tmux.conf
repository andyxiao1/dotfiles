# ============================ tmux-sensible Settings ============================
# source: https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-sensible -- many settings taken
# from here, but I want to be more intentional about what I turn on 

# Address vim mode switching delay
# According to the link a small delay (5ms) is better than 0
# source: http://superuser.com/a/252717/65504
set -s escape-time 5

# Increase scrollback buffer size from 2000 to 50000 lines
set -g history-limit 50000

# Increase tmux messages display duration from 750ms to 4s
# e.g. the status message that shows up when you reload the tmux config
set -g display-time 4000

# Refresh 'status-left' and 'status-right' more often, from every 15s to 5s
# TODO: re-evaluate: how necessary is this?
set -g status-interval 5

# Upgrade $TERM, which tells programs (like vim, less, htop) they can use 256
# colors
set -g default-terminal "screen-256color"

# Focus events enabled for terminals that support them
# TBH I still don't really understand what this does but supposedly it gives
# better UI responsiveness, so I'll turn it on
set -g focus-events on

# Super useful when using "grouped sessions" and multi-monitor setup
# Resizes ALL panes immediately & aggressively to fill space when the terminal
# window itself is resized (the default is to resize only the active pane)
setw -g aggressive-resize on

# TODO: re-evaluate later if I want this. I'm still unsure about if I should
# use vi or emacs editing in the shell
# # Emacs key bindings in tmux command prompt (prefix + :) are better than
# # vi keys, even for vim users
# set -g status-keys emacs

# ================================ Custom Settings ===============================
# Use vi keybindings in copy mode (instead of emacs)
# i.e. when looking at scrollback history via prefix + [ you can use vi
# keybinding
set-window-option -g mode-keys vi

# Automatically renumber window indices when a window is closed
set -g renumber-windows on

# Enables mouse support globally in tmux
# Meaning we can click on windows/panes and use scroll & mouse selection in
# copy mode
# n.b. Mouse scroll & selection also seems to work correctly with mouse
# reporting ON in iterm2 profile->terminal settings
set -g mouse on

# By default, selecting text with the mouse in copy mode copies & exits copy
# mode on unclick, but that is annoying. Instead we only copy on a follow up
# click AND we do not exit copy mode
# n.b. Mouse1 is left click

# ================================================================================
# =================================== Bindings ===================================
# ================================================================================

# Bindings to replicate Vim's visual selection & yank behavior in copy mode
# Goes with the mode-keys vi setting above
# v to start character-wise selection
bind -T copy-mode-vi v send-keys -X begin-selection
# ctrl+v to toggle block (rectangle) selection mode & line selection mode
bind -T copy-mode-vi C-v send-keys -X rectangle-toggle
# y to yank selection & exit copy mode
# With iterm2 & tmux on OSX this seems to work out of the box without tmux-yank
bind -T copy-mode-vi y send-keys -X copy-selection-and-cancel

# Rebind splits and new windows to open in the current directory
# Also split using | and - (instead of % and ")
bind | split-window -h -c "#{pane_current_path}"
bind - split-window -v -c "#{pane_current_path}"

# prefix + r to reload my tmux config
bind r source-file ~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf \; display-message "tmux: Config Reloaded!"

# Vim keybindings to move around panes.
bind h select-pane -L
bind j select-pane -D
bind k select-pane -U
bind l select-pane -R

# Search buffer in one command. (1) enter copy mode (2) send ? which starts a
# backwards search
bind / copy-mode \; send-key ?

# Shift + L/R (arrow) to move windows left or right. I use this to reorganize
# my windows more easily
# n.b. -n denotes we don't need to the tmux prefix
bind -n S-Left swap-window -t -1 -d
bind -n S-Right swap-window -t +1 -d

# TODO: re-evaluate: I feel like I don't switch windows that often or I'm very
# deliberate about my windows
# Bind b (the current prefix key) to quickly switch to previously active window
bind b last-window
